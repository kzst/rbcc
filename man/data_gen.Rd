\title{
Data Generator for Risk-based Multivariate Control Charts
}
\description{
data_gen function simulate the data set from a specified distribution used in the risk based multivariate control chart.
}
\usage{
data_gen(obs, mu, va, sk, ku)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{obs}{The total number of observations of a process. (numeric value).}

\item{va}{The variances of p characteristics. (numeric vector).}
\item{sk}{The skewness of distribution of p characteristics. (numeric vector).}
\item{ku}{The kurtosis of distribution of p characteristics. (numeric vector).}
