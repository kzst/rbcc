\title{
Sample data for Risk-based Multivariate Control Chart
}

\description{
This data set contains measured product characteristic values for handbrake cylinder products. The measured product characteristics are cutting length and main diameter respectively for 50 pieces. Each parameter of each product was measured twice, first with a high-precision optical measurement machine and secondly with manual height measurement device/caliper. Measurement errors are estimated as the difference between the optical and manual measurement results. This dataset can be used to validate Risk-based Multivariate control charts.
