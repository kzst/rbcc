\title{Package of Risk-based Control Charts}

\description{The risk-based is a new methodology to design an optimized control chart that minimized the cost of decision outcomes of the control process. The basic purpose of the risk-based control is to determine the optimal control charts parameters to minimize the risks arising from measurement uncertainty. This article develops an R package for family of risk-based control charts, namely \code{'rbcc'}. In this package, the functions required in the design of family of risk-based control charts univariate and multivariate
